title: VEGA A860, the old strong man!

---

Yesterday, I suddenly found a 99% new A860 at [lequanmobile](http://lequanmobile.com). I saw many A860 before but this time bring me a huge different emotion. Its a phablet with 5,9 inch Full HD IPS, Snapdragon S4 pro inside, 2GB of ram and 32GB internal storage. All the spec factor is not the thing that I most love this device. Its design is even more devil art, attract every eyes at the very first sight.

Its huge on hand. Device is plastic made with curve back cover. This offer a good fix on hand. Notice these sharpness round? While we still thing about device that smooth with round corners. A860 front look different to any devices that come from Korean. With me those make a strong feeling that this is for man because it strong not only from the inside but outside.

Did you know Tekcafe Team is upgrading it to Lollipop 5.1? While Pantech have a traditional that slowly slowly slowly upgrade their device software (shame on Pantech). Our team bring A860 owner the taste of Lollipop since September of 2014. Lollipop is smoother and offer more custom settings than Kitkat official firmware. There are some problems with Lollipop firmware but Tekcafe Team will keep going. While the world is hot with 64-bit arch. I do believe that these APQ8064 devices will keep going till next year. 4x1.5Ghz and 2GB ram is enough for any gamer nowadays.

I am not asking people buying A860 because it seem hard to find a new, origin A860. But those own A860 dont throw it easily. [There are update from Tekcafe Team that make your A860 newer, faster. Just join us and make your A860 different.](http://tekcafe.vn)
